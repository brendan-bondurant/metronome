This was my first foray into using JavaScript. I had some experience with HTML and CSS, but this was also a good way to learn more about that.

I had two weeks off from class and wanted to play around with some apps I had been wanting as a music teacher, designing them to my preference.

Fortunately, I found a great tutorial on YouTube to get me started (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D08gOHOjeEk&list=PLXAhCH9FJ8zU2lR4ZvJGianiyVJlqm0z0&index=1). After that, I was able to make some alterations to the code to make it do what I wanted.

One of the primary changes I wanted was to have each beat listed across the bottom and to highlight the beat when clicked. I would have loved that feature when I was teaching, and now maybe someone else can benefit from it.

Another very important feature for me was the ability to change the emphasis on each beat, rather than having it click only on the downbeat. It defaults to accenting 1, but there is a loud click, a medium click, and no click. I've played a fair amount of music in odd time signatures, and having a metronome with these options is very helpful, especially for something in, say, 11/8 (I've been relearning a piece in that time signature lately, "Walk Dance" by Miroslav Tadic), which I count as 4 + 3 + 4. While not strictly necessary, it is nice to see that beats 1, 5, and 9 are accented.

Finally, for fun, I made it change colors. This is purely superficial, but I was curious how to do it. An update I would make later is to make it more accessible for anyone who may be colorblind. The colors don't actually symbolize anything; they are mostly for my own amusement.

Many thanks to musicandcode (https://github.com/musicandcode) for a great tutorial.
